      <description>In a previous post I attempted to describe &amp;ldquo;Cloud&amp;rdquo; as it appears in IT, where I thought about the plethora of marketing buzzwords that exist in conversations these days. This post should be different. Networks are a fundamental part of IT, be they virtual or physical. To cut to the chase I am going to give my very short version of what I think networks mean, then elaborate on some parts of this definition.</description>

      <description>Describing what I do for work in a casual conversation varies quite a lot these days. My response will depend on the background understanding of the audience. If I am honest, I say I work in &amp;ldquo;IT&amp;rdquo; and move on to more interesting conversation. But, I find what I do really interesting and it is about time I put some thought into explaining the jargon in tech so I can use the vernacular with more people.</description>
