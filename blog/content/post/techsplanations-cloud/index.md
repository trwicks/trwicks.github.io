Describing what I do for work in a casual conversation varies quite widely depending on the audience as I try to give a mental picture of what I do. If I am honest, I say I work in "IT" and move on to more interesting conversation, but I find what I do really interesting and it is about time I put some thought into explaining the jargon in tech so I and other people can understand the vernacular a bit more. Therefore, in this series of posts I am going to explain the terminology commonly used in tech to my Mum, who is someone that gets pretty confused by these words. The first word I feel that gets thrown around a great deal and is a worthy of an honest explanation is "cloud", and this word is a great example of words in the tech industry that appear to have technical meaning but actually are actually well disguised marketing vocobularly. 

Cynics that work in the industry describe the cloud has "someone else's computer", which of course has some truth to it but trivialises the term and is not particularly helpful to the uninitiated. In a more optimistic sense, the cloud can be thought of as third-party hosted platform that provides computing, storage and networking components that can be arranged to build IT infrastructure that runs services for your company. And herein lies the problem, in both those sentences an *excessive* amount of technology concepts (computers, networking, data centres, virtualisation, cloud providers etc) are glossed over, which need to be explained in sufficient detail for the non-technical audience to grasp why the cloud can be thought of as "someone else's computer". But if you look at the word "cloud" from a perspective of someone wanting to understand it as business concept and not technical concept, the term becomes much easier comprehend: 

> the cloud is a marketing term that describes a business model, where by IT infrastructure is provided as different service offerings to paying customers so they can host services for their customers, which allows the business using these services to benefit from the scale of the cloud provider and not having to manage the underlying physical IT infrastructure. 

I must apologies to my Mum here for misrepresenting what I do as a "cloud engineer" as it appears on my LinkedIn and I am sure I have used it once or twice in conversation. The cloud is a marketing term that was really designed to be aimed at board rooms of executives rather than technical professionals. This also means that word really shouldn't be aimed at customers of technology products either as it only serves as a facade to describe IT infrastructure managed by Apple, for example. In my opinion, I don't think it is worth salvaging the word "cloud" for any meaningful interpretation in a technical context, and instead I think it is better to focus the other components of the cloud that are obfuscated away by the term. Networking, servers, storage and software are more worthy candidates explanation as they stand up by themselves in describing the thing they represent, which I will attempt to describe in later posts in this series. Discussing these topics in an approachable way with non-technical people will help aid understanding of what technology people look after, in the same way we have an appreciation of what doctors, carpenters and accountants do. 

And as a last aside, as I have worked in the tech industry, I think it is good to have a healthy appreciation for discerning what words are merely marketing buzzwords and which ones deserve your attention as being a part of the way you describe subjects in the field of technology. This is because the quality of your communication matters, as the cost of using marketing fluff words is less accurately describing the things you are truly passionate about. 

Thank you for reading.
