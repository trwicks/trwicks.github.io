## Introduction

In a previous post I attempted to describe "Cloud" as it appears in IT and rumenated on the plethora of marketing buzzwords that exist in conversations these days. This post should be different. Networks are a fundamental part of IT, be they virtual or physical. To cut to the chase I am going to give my very short version of what I think networks mean, then elaborate on some parts. 

> A network provides the capability for devices to transmit data over a medium to a other devices.

There are two key parts in the previous definition. First, devices need to be able to send messages containing data to another device. Second, the transfer of this data needs to be sent via some mechanism so the message can travel over a distance. The first part is similar to sending a letter to a friend. In this analogy you need to know the address of the friend's house and you need to send your message as a letter in an envelope or parcel. The second part can be thought of as roads and airways that allow a vehicle to transfer the letter from one spot to the next until it reaches your friend's house. 

With these concepts in mind we can examine how the laptop or PC in your home is part of a network. Using the first part of the definition it can be assertained that your laptop will request resources from other devices - to get the content from a website, for example. Simplifying the process quite a lot your computer will get the address of the website (IP address) and send a message to the website to get a webpage. The website, once it receives your request message, will then send you the content of the webpage back to your address. But, because the website is located on a server that is not inside your house your message gets sent via a gateway (normally a modem-router) that then finds the next recipent to send your message to in order for it to reach the website.
